\title{Bi-directional communication with R and AWS S3.}
\description{
This package provides an interface to read and store arbitrary
objects from and to Amazon AWS's S3 cloud storage.
}
\details{
The exported helpers \code{s3read} and \code{s3store}
allow, upon correct configuration of your S3 credentials,
uploading to and downloading from S3 using R's built-in support
for serializing and deserializing arbitrary objects (see
\code{\link{readRDS}} and \code{\link{saveRDS}}).
